Sample Amazon Sagemaker Notebooks for the Hackathon for Good 2022 edition

# How-to: get the AWS Credits
AWS provides the hackathon participants with credits for all AWS-services.

When you create your account and get the AWS credits you can start using the AWS Console with the credits (500USD worth of credits*). From the console they can use any AWS service (like S3, Sagemaker, EC2 or other). These credits will be valid until the end of 2022. 


## Activation instructions: 
- Request the AWS Credit to the organizers (ask Mathis in your team chat  or message Milena).
- Organizers review the request making sure there is only one person from each team who can use the credit.
- Organizers issue the credit code to the requesting participant.
- Participants follow the procedure at: https://aws.amazon.com/awscredits/ to redeem the credit (you need to have a valid AWS account or create one).
- Login into an AWS account.
- Use AWS console.

*When creating an AWS account you are required to provide a credit card. Your card will not be charged for fees for eligible services until you incur fees for eligible services that exceed available promotional credit. Make sure your credits are activated in the console before using any AWS services.
